**Support - TaskBuddy: Eisenhower Matrix**

Organize, prioritize, and conquer your day using the proven Eisenhower Matrix — the 4-quadrant time management framework trusted by high performers.

**Getting Started**

1. Launch TaskBuddy on your device
2. Complete the interactive onboarding to learn about:
   - The 4-quadrant Eisenhower Matrix
   - How to classify tasks by importance and urgency
   - Workspaces and tags for organization
3. Add your first task by tapping the "+" button in any quadrant
4. Optional: Create Workspaces in Settings to organize tasks by project or context
5. Optional: Subscribe to Pro for unlimited workspaces and subtasks

**Understanding the 4 Quadrants**

- **Q1 — Important & Urgent**: Crises, critical deadlines, fires that need immediate action. Aim to minimize this quadrant.
- **Q2 — Important & Not Urgent**: Strategic planning, skill growth, health, and long-term goals. This is your *success quadrant* — spend most of your time here.
- **Q3 — Not Important & Urgent**: Interruptions, non-critical meetings, and busy work. Delegate or eliminate these when possible.
- **Q4 — Not Important & Not Urgent**: Distractions, mindless scrolling, and time wasters. Be mindful of time spent here.

**Tips & Best Practices**

- **Q2 is your power zone**: Schedule time each day for important-but-not-urgent tasks before fires take over
- **Keep Q1 small**: A large Q1 means reactive living — plan ahead to prevent crises
- **Delegate Q3**: Not everything urgent deserves your personal attention
- **Review daily**: Spend a moment each morning placing new tasks in the right quadrant
- **Use Workspaces**: Separate work, personal, and side projects with dedicated workspaces
- **Pin wisely**: Use task pinning to highlight the 1-3 things that matter most today
